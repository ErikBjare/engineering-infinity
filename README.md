Engineering Infinity
=====================

## About
Just another small 3D project I'll never finish, uploading to GitHub to I can test the 3D preview of `.stl` files.

## Theme
Portrays a Infinity-sign being worked on
by robotic limbs and machinery.

### Color style
Bright blue lights and sparks lighting up
a dark surrounding lit by a dim light.

### Background alternatives
 1. Black/nothingness
 2. Space (machinery is encapsulated in a spacestation with sun/stars/galaxies visible in the distance)
 3. Machine room
